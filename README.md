## Problem Statement

Traditional education systems face several fundamental issues that blockchain technology can solve:

### 1. Credential Verification Crisis
- **Current Problem**: Paper certificates and PDFs are easily forged, verification is time-consuming and expensive
- **Blockchain Solution**: Immutable, cryptographically secure digital credentials that can be verified instantly
- **Impact**: Eliminates fraud, reduces verification costs by 80%, enables instant global verification

### 2. Limited Value in Educational Achievements
- **Current Problem**: Grades and achievements have no real-world value, locked within institutional systems
- **Blockchain Solution**: Tokenized achievements with real economic value, tradeable across platforms
- **Impact**: Creates "Learn-to-Earn" economy, increases student motivation, enables cross-platform portability

### 3. Centralized Platform Dependencies
- **Current Problem**: Single platforms control all data and charge high fees (20-30% commission)
- **Blockchain Solution**: Decentralized P2P learning marketplace with minimal fees
- **Impact**: Instructors earn 95%+ of course fees, students pay less, global access without barriers

### 4. Intellectual Property Protection
- **Current Problem**: Content creators have no proof of ownership, difficult to track usage and receive royalties
- **Blockchain Solution**: Timestamped content ownership, automated royalty distribution via smart contracts
- **Impact**: Protects creator rights, enables passive income, transparent usage tracking

## Smart Contract Architecture

### Core Program Structure

The system is built on Solana using Anchor framework with the following key components:

#### 1. LMS Account (Program State)
```rust
pub struct LmsAccount {
    pub authority: Pubkey,           // System administrator
    pub name: String,               // Platform name
    pub description: String,        // Platform description
    pub total_courses: u64,         // Total courses created
    pub total_students: u64,        // Total students enrolled
    pub total_instructors: u64,    // Total instructors registered
    pub bump: u8,                  // PDA bump seed
}
```

#### 2. Course Management
```rust
pub struct Course {
    pub course_id: String,         // Unique course identifier
    pub title: String,            // Course title
    pub description: String,       // Course description
    pub instructor: Pubkey,        // Instructor's wallet address
    pub price: u64,               // Price in lamports (SOL)
    pub max_students: u32,        // Maximum enrollment capacity
    pub current_students: u32,    // Current enrollment count
    pub is_active: bool,          // Course availability status
    pub created_at: i64,          // Creation timestamp
    pub bump: u8,                 // PDA bump seed
}
```

#### 3. Enrollment System
```rust
pub struct Enrollment {
    pub enrollment_id: String,    // Unique enrollment identifier
    pub student: Pubkey,          // Student's wallet address
    pub course: Pubkey,           // Course account address
    pub enrolled_at: i64,         // Enrollment timestamp
    pub is_active: bool,         // Enrollment status
    pub progress: u8,            // Completion percentage (0-100)
    pub bump: u8,                // PDA bump seed
}
```

#### 4. Certificate Issuance
```rust
pub struct Certificate {
    pub certificate_id: String,   // Unique certificate identifier
    pub student: Pubkey,         // Student's wallet address
    pub course: Pubkey,          // Course account address
    pub instructor: Pubkey,       // Issuing instructor
    pub credential_type: CredentialType, // Type of credential
    pub metadata_uri: String,     // IPFS metadata URI
    pub issued_at: i64,          // Issue timestamp
    pub is_verified: bool,        // Verification status
    pub bump: u8,                // PDA bump seed
}
```

#### 5. Achievement Tokenization
```rust
pub struct Achievement {
    pub student: Pubkey,          // Student's wallet address
    pub achievement_type: AchievementType, // Type of achievement
    pub amount: u64,             // Token amount awarded
    pub awarded_at: i64,         // Award timestamp
    pub bump: u8,                // PDA bump seed
}
```

### Smart Contract Functions

#### 1. System Initialization
```rust
pub fn initialize_lms(
    ctx: Context<InitializeLms>,
    name: String,
    description: String,
) -> Result<()>
```
- Creates the main LMS account
- Sets up system authority
- Initializes global statistics

#### 2. Course Creation
```rust
pub fn create_course(
    ctx: Context<CreateCourse>,
    course_id: String,
    title: String,
    description: String,
    price: u64,
    max_students: u32,
) -> Result<()>
```
- Instructors can create courses with pricing
- Courses are stored as Program Derived Addresses (PDAs)
- Automatic course ID generation and validation

#### 3. Student Enrollment
```rust
pub fn enroll_student(
    ctx: Context<EnrollStudent>,
    enrollment_id: String,
) -> Result<()>
```
- Students enroll in courses with payment verification
- Enrollment creates immutable record on blockchain
- Automatic course capacity management

#### 4. Certificate Issuance
```rust
pub fn issue_certificate(
    ctx: Context<IssueCertificate>,
    certificate_id: String,
    credential_type: CredentialType,
    metadata_uri: String,
) -> Result<()>
```

    ctx: Context<AwardTokens>,
    amount: u64,
    achievement_type: AchievementType,
) -> Result<()>
```

- Progress stored immutably on blockchain
- Enables automated certificate issuance

### Security Features

#### 1. Program Derived Addresses (PDAs)
- All accounts use deterministic address generation
- Prevents address collisions and ensures uniqueness
- Seeds-based account creation for security

#### 2. Access Control
- Role-based permissions (Student, Instructor, Admin)
- Signature verification for all transactions
- Constraint-based account validation

#### 3. Error Handling
```rust
#[error_code]
pub enum ErrorCode {
    #[msg("Invalid progress percentage")]
    InvalidProgress,
    #[msg("Course is full")]
    CourseFull,
    #[msg("Course is not active")]
    CourseInactive,
    #[msg("Unauthorized access")]
    Unauthorized,
}
```
